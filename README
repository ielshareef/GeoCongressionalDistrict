Find your Congressional District by providing a complete US address or a loose description of an address OR if you're at home, let the browser's Geolocation API goodness find your district for ya!. Note: Depending on the browser's Geolocation API for mission critical applications is not recommended since it is not always accurate.

This has been tested only in Chrome 5+, FireFox 3.6+, and Safari 5+ on OS X 10.6+.

Address Examples that return my district (CA, 30):
1235 N. Kings Rd, West Hollywood, CA
1235 Kings in West Hollywood, CA
1235 Kings in West Hollywood
Near Santa Monica Blvd and La Cienega
At the corner of Kings Rd. and Fountain Ave.
